# LinkTree Clone

In an attempt to mirror Linktree's impressive system, I'm working on this project. Using Next.js and Tailwind CSS, my focus is on crafting the user admin side, incorporating features such as login, sign-up, and the user links page.

## Description

LinkTree stands out as a widely used platform enabling users to fashion a customized landing page featuring multiple links to their diverse social media profiles or websites. Through replicating LinkTree, my aim is to elevate my proficiency as a developer and cultivate a more profound comprehension of Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

## Features

- Authentication System: Establish a robust login and sign-up mechanism to ensure secure user access.
- Admin Dashboard for Users: Construct an intuitive interface, allowing users to effortlessly manage their links and personalize their profiles.
- Links Management Page: Formulate a dedicated page enabling users to add, modify, and organize their links, complete with custom names and descriptions.
